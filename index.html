            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>I am a mother of 3 children and they are my life’s primary focus. They
                are major reasons
                for my life's choices. Each one of them has unique stories, personalities, and passions. In this
                site I am sharing only one part of their lives. </p>
            <p>Jameela my oldest daughter since kindergarten has taken many paths to where she is now.
                She has
                made numerous, educational and career changes but one passion remained constant, her
                love for music.
                So if your passion is music but making your living in a different field. You especially
                will find her story very interesting.</p>
            <p>Solaman my middle child, got married a few years back to a great girl named Sasha. What
                is unique is that this wedding took place in Pakistan. How it was a arrange marriage
                with unfamiliar culture and customs is what I have highlighted on his site.</span>
            </p>
            <p>Sidra my youngest one who loves to write stories, poetry, and draw. On her page is a
                tour of her books and stories.</p>

                        You may give them your love but not your thoughts, for they have their own thoughts.
                        You may house their
                        bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow which you
                        cannot visit, not
                        even in your dreams.…”

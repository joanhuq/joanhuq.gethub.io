      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>My children are my primary interest and what motivates a lot of my choices.
        Each one of them has unique stories. <br>
        <br> In this site I am sharing only one part of their lives.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jameela my oldest daughter has taken many paths to where she is now but one thing that remains constant is
          her
          love of music. If you love music but are looking for a different career in other fields you might find this
          interesting.</li>
        <li>Solaman my middle child lives in California with his wife Sasha. On his page, you might find his Pakistan
          wedding culture and tradition of interest. </li>
        <li>Sidra my youngest interests are writing and drawing. On her page is a tour of her books.</li>
      </ul>

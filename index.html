            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p> <span> I am a mother of 3 children and they are my life’s primary focus. They
                    are major reasons
                    for
                    my life's choices. Each one of them has unique stories, personalities, and passions. </span>
                <span>In this site I am sharing only one part of their lives. </span>
                <p>Jameela my oldest daughter since kindergarten has taken many paths to where she is now.
                    She has
                    made numerous, educational and career changes but one passion remained constant, her
                    love for music.
                    So if your passion is music but making your living in a different field. You especially
                    will find her story very interesting.

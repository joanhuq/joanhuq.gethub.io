                <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>I am a mother of 3 children and they are my life’s primary focus. They
                    are major reasons
                    for my life's choices. Each one of them has unique stories, personalities, and passions. In this
                    site I am sharing only one part of their lives. </p>
                <p>Jameela my oldest daughter since kindergarten has taken many paths to where she is now.
                    She has
                    made numerous, educational and career changes but one passion remained constant, her
                    love for music.
                    So if your passion is music but making your living in a different field. You especially
                    will find her story very interesting.</p>
                <p>Solaman my middle child, got married a few years back to a great girl named Sasha. What
                    is unique is that this wedding took place in Pakistan. How it was a arrange marriage
                    with unfamiliar culture and customs is what I have highlighted on his site.</span>

                            You may house their
                            bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow which you
                            cannot visit, not
                            even in your dreams.…”

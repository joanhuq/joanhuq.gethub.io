        <h3>Pakistan wedding events</h3>
        <p>Solaman married a few years ago in Pakistan. The wedding ceremony consists of two main events –the Nikkah
            and Walima, both events are culturally and traditionally influenced.
            To understand the importance, it is best to understand the Pakistani culture. Marriage is not only
            considered a union between husband and wife, but also a union between their families.

                <dt>Mehdi</dt>
                <dd>The Mehndi ceremony is held the night before the wedding as a way of wishing the bride good
                    health and success as she makes her journey on to the marriage.</dd>
                <dt>Baraat</dt>
                <dd>Baraat is a celebratory wedding procession of the groom to the Nikah event. </dd>
                <dt>Nikah</dt>
                <dd>The Nikah is the formal marriage ceremony where a marriage contract is signed by both the
                    bride and the groom in the presence of close family members. The Nikah is typically performed by
                    a religious scholar at a mosque, who is licensed by the government to perform the ceremony. The
                    dinner is served after the bride and group say their vows. </dd>
                <dt>Walima</dt>
                <dd>The Walima is the formal reception hosted by the bridegroom and his family. This is a way of
                    welcoming the bride and her family into the groom's family; it is typically a huge celebration
                    with relatives and friends as the guests of both families. There is food served and
                    entertainment during this occasion.

                    daughter was given the basket
                    of roses to throw at the bride and groom. But rather than throwing over their head she being
                    mischievous, took handfuls
                    and threw right at her brother getting flower peddles in his hair.

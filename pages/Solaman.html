            <h3>Pakistsan Wedding Events Definitions</h3>
            <p class="p-left">
                Solaman married a few years ago in Pakistan.</p>
            <ul> The wedding ceremony consists of two main events:
                <li>Nikkah</li>
                <li>Walima</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Both events are culturally and traditionally influenced.
                To understand the importance, it is best to understand the Pakistani culture. Marriage is not only
                considered a union between husband and wife, but also a union between their families.

        <article class="container-golden">
            <p> First, let me start with the list of events along with their definitions.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Mehdi</dt>
                <dd>The Mehndi ceremony is held the night before the wedding as a way of wishing the bride good
                    health and success as she makes her journey on to the marriage.</dd>
                <dt>Baraat</dt>
                <dd>Baraat is a celebratory wedding procession of the groom to the Nikah event. </dd>
                <dt>Nikah</dt>
                <dd>The Nikah is the formal marriage ceremony where a marriage contract is signed by both the
                    bride and the groom in the presence of close family members. The Nikah is typically performed by
                    a religious scholar at a mosque, who is licensed by the government to perform the ceremony. The
                    dinner is served after the bride and group say their vows. </dd>
                <dt>Walima</dt>
                <dd>The Walima is the formal reception hosted by the bridegroom and his family. This is a way of
                    welcoming the bride and her family into the groom's family; it is typically a huge celebration
                    with relatives and friends as the guests of both families. There is food served and
                    entertainment during this occasion.

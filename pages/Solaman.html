        <h3>Pakistan Wedding Events</h3>
        <p>Solaman married a few years ago in Pakistan. The wedding consisted of two main events –the Nikkah and Walima
            combined with smaller traditions and occasions.
            To understand why all these events are so important, it is best to understand culturally, marriages are not
            only
            seen as a union between a husband and a wife, but also a union between their families.
            First, let me start with the list of events along with a definition.</p>
        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Mehdi</dt>
            <dd>- The Mehndi ceremony is held the night before the wedding as a way of wishing the bride good health and
                success as she makes her journey on to the marriage.</dd>
            <dt>Baraat</dt>
            <dd>- Baraat is a celebratory wedding procession for the groom. </dd>
            <dt>Nikah</dt>
            <dd>- The Nikah is the formal marriage ceremony where a marriage contract is signed by both the bride and
                the
                groom in the presence of close family members. The Nikah is typically performed by a religious scholar
                at a
                mosque, who is licensed by the government to perform the ceremony. </dd>
            <dt>Walima</dt>
            <dd>- The Walima is the formal reception hosted by the husband and wife and officially makes the marriage
                public. It is typically a huge celebration with many relatives and guests of both families in
                attendance.
            </dd>

                    <br> The night was filled with dancing, songs, and food.</p>

                    The Walima was held the next day hosted by the groom’s side. <br>
                    <br> Our family greeted guests by throwing roses over their heads. Our family also present garland
                    to the bride's Mother and Father which is worn around the neck.
                    <br> When Solaman and Sasha arrived my Sidra my youngest daughter was given the basket of roses
                    to throw at the bride and groom. <br>
                    <br> But rather than throwing over their head she took handfuls and threw right at her brother
                    getting
                    flower peddles in his hair. </p>

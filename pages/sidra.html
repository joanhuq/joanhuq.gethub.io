        <p>Let me take you on a tour of other dimensions that exist in the mind of my youngest daughter. Places and
            characters as real to her as her family and friends</p>

                    The first place on our tour is a land called a way to understand. <br>
                    <br> This place is very similar to our world, with people who deal with similar problems. <br>
                    <br> Imagine feeling cut off from someone you want to be friends with, despite sitting two feet
                    from them every day! <br>
                    <br> Jacob Venetianer faces this problem when a new student named Kayla Bryd comes to Lakewood
                    Middle
                    School. <br>
                    <br> The two would love to become better friends and share their interests, but they have challenges
                    to overcome: <br>
                    <strong>Jacob is deaf, and Kayla is blind.</strong> <br>
                    <br> This makes it very difficult for these two to communicate.

                    Next on our journey, we come to a dimension where animals live with cultures, feelings, and
                    lives that are similar to ours. <br>
                    <br> They also have to deal with many similar issues: bigotry, culture, diversity, and religious
                    stereotyping.
                    It’s the first time Princess Puffpuffikins III a young cardinal princess goes outside of the
                    castle by herself.

                    Along the way she meets an elderly purple fox: Amethyst Purplestar
                    He warns her about other animals that live there that should not be trusted: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tarantella Maximillian </li>
                    <li>Canidae family</li>
                    <li>Toksis family</li>
                </ul>

                    When she meets them she finds them nothing like what the purple fox said they would
                    be.

                    The Toksis family and the Canidae family are close, always spending time
                    together. <br>
                    <br> One time in September the Toksis families decide to invite the Canidae
                    family to an Eid al-Fitr
                    party.
